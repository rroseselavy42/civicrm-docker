# TODO

* Work out if we really need to set the  CIVICRM_UF environment variable in the CMS specific parts of the Dockerfile, and remove if not.
* Order combinations and tags sensibly
* Auto generate tags file
* Auto generate docker-compose files
* Incorporate docs/getting-started.md into README.md
* Get really accurate about the responsibilities of init, and install so they can work OK in different db environments
* Document the new ideas around MySQL
